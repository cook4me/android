## Setup

This project depends on a specific release of the Jacoco library, which has been updated to provide coverage support for Jetpack Compose. This release is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/epfl-SDP/jacoco-compose), and requires the use of the GitHub Apache Maven Package Repository. Therefore, you are required to add the following to your `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` file to access the Maven package.

```properties
githubJacocoUsername=YourGitHubUsername
# Requires at least the read:packages scope.
githubJacocoPassword=YourGitHubPersonalAccessToken
```

As this project uses Google Firebase, you will also need to provide your own google-services.json.

This file can be generated from the Firebase Console (Project -> Project Settings -> Your apps -> SDK setup and configuration -> google-services.json).

It must be placed at ./app/google-services.json
